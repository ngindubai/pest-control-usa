    intro:
      "Pest control in Milwaukee follows the seasons in a way that most warmer cities don't. The cold winters do real work: mosquitoes, outdoor ants, and many other seasonal pests are genuinely suppressed from November through March, which is a relief. But that same cold is why mice enter Milwaukee homes faster and in larger numbers than almost anywhere in the country when October arrives. German cockroaches run year-round regardless of temperature, carpenter ants are active from April through September in the older neighborhoods, and yellow jackets are aggressive through the late summer warm stretch.",

The mice are not choosing your home out of curiosity: they are following temperature gradients and seeking food. Older brick apartment buildings and the wood-frame duplexes in neighborhoods like Bay View, Riverwest, and Shorewood have more entry points than newer construction. The practical response is inspection and exclusion work in September, before the surge, not in November after it has happened.",

They nest in moist or softened wood, which means wood around leaky windows, door frames with water damage, and tree limbs in contact with the roofline. They do not eat wood but excavate it, and an established colony can cause real structural damage over several years. Seeing large black ants indoors in spring, often more than a couple at a time, suggests a colony is established within or adjacent to the building.",

        question: "Why do mice seem to appear suddenly in Milwaukee each fall?",
        answer:
          "House mice begin moving inside as outdoor temperatures drop, following warmth and the smell of food. In Milwaukee, October brings a rapid temperature drop that triggers a fast, concentrated surge of mice into buildings.

Carpenter ant damage has clean, smooth galleries. Termite damage is rough and filled with soil-like debris. Both require professional inspection to confirm, and both require treatment.",

Ground nests, wall voids, and nests under eaves are all common. Treating them in spring when they are small is far easier and safer than dealing with them at peak size.",
