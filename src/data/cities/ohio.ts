    intro:
      "Pest control in Columbus follows the seasons closely. Summer brings ants, wasps, and mosquitoes, but the defining event is autumn, when cooling weather pushes mice and overwintering insects indoors in numbers. Bed bugs and German roaches are the steady year-round indoor problems, helped along by apartment living. A home that is sealed and treated before the first cold snap stays quiet through winter, while one that is not becomes a refuge.",

      {
        heading: "Why fall is the busy season",
        body: "Most pests cannot survive an Ohio winter outdoors, so they move inside. Mice slip through gaps as small as a pencil, and ladybug-like beetles and other overwintering insects pack into wall voids on the warm side of the house. The work that matters is exclusion in late summer and early fall, sealing entry points before the rush, rather than chasing pests once they are already in the walls.",

        heading: "Carpenter ants as a moisture clue",
        body: "Carpenter ants tunnel through wood rather than eating it, and they prefer wood that is already damp or damaged. Finding them indoors often points to a leak or poor ventilation as much as an ant problem. A thorough inspection treats the ants and flags the moisture source behind them, so the problem does not simply return.",

        question: "Why do mice get into Columbus homes in the fall?",
        answer:
          "Mice cannot survive the winter outdoors, so as the cold arrives they move inside through gaps as small as a pencil width and settle in walls and basements. Sealing entry points in late summer and early fall, before the rush, is the most effective defense.",

        question: "Are carpenter ants damaging my home?",
        answer:
          "Carpenter ants tunnel through wood to nest rather than eating it, and they prefer damp or damaged wood. Finding them indoors often points to a moisture problem, so the fix usually addresses both the ants and the source of the damp.",

        question: "Does Columbus have a bed bug problem?",
        answer:
          "Yes, Ohio cities including Columbus rank high for bed bug activity. They spread through apartments and on secondhand furniture, so inspecting used items and acting early on any signs is important.",

        question: "When are wasps worst in Columbus?",
        answer:
          "Paper wasp and yellowjacket nests grow all summer and are largest and most aggressive in late summer, around August and September, around eaves, decks, and sheds. Removing small nests early in the season is far easier than dealing with a mature one.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need pest control in an Ohio winter?",
        answer:
          "The outdoor season is short, so many homes focus on fall exclusion and a spring follow-up. If mice or roaches are already inside over winter, treatment continues until the home is sealed and clear.",
