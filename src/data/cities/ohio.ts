        question: "Why does Toledo have such a strong mosquito season?",
        answer:
          "Toledo sits on the former Great Black Swamp, drained for farmland but still characterized by flat, poorly draining terrain that holds water. Combined with Lake Erie, the Maumee River, and farmland drainage, this creates abundant mosquito breeding habitat. West Nile virus has been recorded in Lucas County. Removing standing water and treating resting areas reduces exposure.",

        question: "When do mice get into Toledo homes?",
        answer:
          "The surge arrives in October and November as temperatures drop, driving mice into heated buildings through gaps around foundations, pipes, and utilities. Homes on the agricultural edges see additional field rodent pressure. Sealing entry points in September, before the cold, is the most effective prevention.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do cockroaches survive Toledo winters?",
        answer:
          "Yes. German cockroaches live entirely indoors in heated spaces and are not affected by the cold. They maintain populations year-round in kitchens, bathrooms, and wall voids, spreading through shared plumbing in multi-family buildings. The winter has no impact on indoor cockroach colonies.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the bugs on my Toledo house in fall?",
        answer:
          "Most likely boxelder bugs and cluster flies. They aggregate on warm, sun-facing walls in fall and search for cracks that lead inside to overwinter. They are harmless and do not damage the home. Sealing gaps around windows and siding before fall reduces how many get in.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is year-round pest control necessary in Toledo?",
        answer:
          "Many Toledo homes do well with a seasonal plan given the cold winters: fall rodent and overwintering-insect exclusion, summer mosquito service, and carpenter ant treatment as needed. Homes with cockroach pressure or recurring rodent activity may benefit from a continuous plan. A free inspection sets the right schedule.",
