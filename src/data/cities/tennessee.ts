        answer:
          "Knoxville's proximity to the Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding forested terrain amplifies stink bug fall aggregation. The invasive brown marmorated stink bug is established across east Tennessee and moves from forested areas into buildings to overwinter each fall. Sealing the home before September and treating the exterior as they begin to aggregate gives the best results.",

          "Yellow jackets are present from spring through fall but reach their largest colony size and most aggressive behavior from August through October. Ground nests in the wooded terrain around Knoxville can grow to thousands of individuals. Disturbing a ground nest accidentally is the most common way to get stung. Professional removal is safer than treating yellow jacket ground nests yourself.",

          "The proximity to forested Smoky Mountain terrain does increase fall mouse pressure compared with more landlocked Tennessee cities. Mice move out of the forested areas as food becomes scarce in October and press hard into buildings. Sealing entry points in September is the most effective prevention.",

          "The lake and the Tennessee River corridor do create sustained breeding habitat through the warm season. The Asian tiger mosquito bites during the day, and Knox County runs surveillance for mosquito-borne illness. Homes near the lake and the river system see heavier pressure than those further inland. Removing standing water on the property and treating shaded resting areas handles the household-level contribution.",
