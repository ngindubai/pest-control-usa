    intro:
      "Pest control in Boston is inseparable from the city's age. The triple-deckers, row houses, and pre-war apartment blocks that define neighborhood after neighborhood were built before the gaps and voids that now give rats, mice, and cockroaches their comfortable passage through shared walls and old sewer connections. The cold winters do reduce outdoor pest pressure significantly, which is a genuine advantage. But indoors, rodents and German cockroaches run year-round regardless of what the thermometer says. Termites are active spring through fall, and bed bugs are a consistent concern in the dense apartment stock.",

        body: "Boston's rat problem is structural. The combination of Victorian-era sewers, alley access behind dense row houses, and a food service industry concentrated in walkable neighborhoods gives Norway rats exceptional harborage and food supply. The most effective control work addresses both the bait and the access: sealing foundation cracks, replacing damaged vent screens, and eliminating the harborage sites under stairs and around HVAC equipment. Baiting alone without exclusion is a temporary fix.",

        body: "Boston winters genuinely suppress mosquitoes, outdoor ants, and many other seasonal pests. That is a real benefit. What the cold does not do is reduce rats, mice, or cockroaches, which simply move deeper into heated buildings when the temperature drops. A hard freeze can push mice into a home that was fine all summer. The seasonal pattern here means spring and summer inspections for termites and exterior pests, and year-round vigilance for the rodent and cockroach pressure that never fully pauses.",

        question: "Why does Boston have such a persistent rat problem?",
        answer:
          "Boston's rat population is sustained by Victorian-era sewer infrastructure, dense neighborhoods with alleys behind rowhouses, and a large restaurant and food service industry. The older housing stock provides abundant harborage and access into buildings. Neighborhoods like the South End, Back Bay, and Fenway have some of the highest complaint rates. Effective control combines bait with structural exclusion work.",

        question: "Do mice go away in winter in Boston?",
        answer:
          "No. The cold actually makes the situation worse indoors. Mice that were living partly outdoors through summer are driven fully inside when temperatures drop. A building that seemed mouse-free in July can have active mice by November. Fall is the right time to seal entry points before the seasonal surge.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are termites a real concern in Boston?",
        answer:
          "Yes. New England subterranean termites are active and can cause significant structural damage, particularly in the region's many older wood-frame homes. They swarm in April through June, which is often the first visible sign of an established colony. Annual inspections are recommended for any home with a crawl space or wood near the foundation.",
      },
      {
        question: "How common are bed bugs in Boston?",
        answer:
          "Fairly common. Boston's high density, university population, and significant apartment turnover create sustained bed bug pressure, particularly in densely rented neighborhoods and areas near campuses. The best defense is inspecting second-hand furniture before it enters the home and knowing the signs: small dark spots on mattress seams and a sweet, musty odor.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is year-round pest control worth it in Boston?",
        answer:
          "For urban apartments and older multi-family buildings, yes. Rodents and cockroaches are year-round concerns that do not pause for winter. Exterior pests like mosquitoes are seasonal, but the indoor pest pressure that defines Boston's pest environment needs continuous management.",
