      "Charlotte's mild Piedmont winters never really shut pests down. Subterranean termites stay active across much of the year here, which is why an annual inspection matters more than people moving from the North expect.",
    intro:
      "Pest control in Charlotte is driven by the humid Piedmont climate. The long, warm, wet season stretches the termite and mosquito calendar well past what a northern city sees, and fire ants have spread firmly into the region. Subterranean termites are the expensive, quiet risk. Mosquitoes and fire ants are the everyday outdoor battle. For homeowners who moved here from cooler states, the surprise is how little the winter slows any of it down.",

      {
        heading: "Termite pressure in the Piedmont",
        body: "First, the risk that matters most: subterranean termites are heavy across the Charlotte area and stay active for much of the year in this climate. They come up from the soil through mud tubes to reach wood. The early signs are easy to miss, so an annual inspection is the practical defense, especially for homes with crawl spaces or any wood-to-soil contact.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Mosquitoes and fire ants through the warm months",
        body: "What most homeowners deal with day to day is the outdoor pressure. Mosquitoes, including the day-biting Asian tiger mosquito, breed in standing water through a long season. Fire ants build mounds that rebuild fast after rain and sting readily. Reducing standing water and treating mounds and resting areas keeps both manageable across spring, summer, and fall.",
      },
    ],
    prevention: [
      "Keep an annual termite inspection on the calendar given Piedmont pressure.",
      "Empty anything holding water after rain to cut mosquito breeding.",
      "Treat fire ant mounds early before they spread across the yard.",
      "Reduce mulch and moisture against the foundation to limit roaches and termites.",

      "With year-round termite risk and a long mosquito and fire ant season, many Charlotte homes pair a recurring plan with an annual termite check. A free inspection sets the plan to your property.",

      {
        question: "Are termites a big risk in Charlotte?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The Piedmont has heavy eastern subterranean termite pressure, and the mild climate keeps colonies active for much of the year. They reach wood through mud tubes from the soil, and the early signs are easy to miss, so an annual inspection is strongly recommended.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is mosquito season in Charlotte?",
        answer:
          "It runs roughly spring through fall, longer than in northern cities, thanks to warm, wet weather. The day-biting Asian tiger mosquito is common here. Removing standing water and treating shaded resting areas reduces the bites.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are fire ants in the Charlotte area?",
        answer:
          "Yes, red imported fire ants are established across the NC Piedmont. Their mounds rebuild quickly after rain and their stings are a hazard for children and pets, so treating mounds early in the season is worthwhile.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why do roaches come indoors in Charlotte?",
        answer:
          "American roaches breed outdoors in mulch, crawl spaces, and drains and move inside in the heat, while German roaches breed indoors in kitchens. Reducing moisture and mulch against the home and sealing entry points keeps the outdoor type out.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is winter pest control necessary here?",
        answer:
          "The mild Piedmont winter does not fully stop pests, so termite risk and indoor roaches continue. Many homes keep a year-round plan rather than treating only in the warm months.",
