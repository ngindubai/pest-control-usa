      "Pest control in New Orleans is dominated by one thing: termites, specifically the invasive Formosan subterranean termite. The city is the most heavily infested in the country, the damage to historic buildings was severe enough to launch a major federal control program, and the colonies here are large and fast. Beyond termites, the warm, wet, low-lying setting keeps mosquitoes, American roaches, fire ants, and rats active all year, with flooding regularly reshuffling the whole picture. There is no off-season to count on.",

        heading: "The Formosan termite problem",
        body: "Formosan termites are not the slow, native kind. They form colonies that can number in the millions and cause structural damage far faster than native subterranean termites. New Orleans is the worst-affected US city, and the historic housing stock is especially vulnerable. An annual inspection and a monitored barrier or bait system are sensible protection for any home here, and early signs like swarming in late spring should never be ignored.",

        heading: "How flooding changes everything",
        body: "Every major flood reshuffles the pests. Floodwater pushes roaches and rats out of the ground and sewers and into homes, and fire ants raft together on the water before recolonizing dry ground. After a flood, the calls climb for weeks. Planning for that, rather than reacting to it, is what keeps a home manageable in a city where water is never far away.",

        question: "Why are Formosan termites such a problem in New Orleans?",
        answer:
          "New Orleans is the most heavily infested US city for invasive Formosan subterranean termites. They form huge, aggressive colonies and damage wood far faster than native termites, and they badly affected historic French Quarter buildings, which led to a major control program. Annual inspections and a treatment barrier are strongly recommended.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is mosquito season in New Orleans?",
        answer:
          "Close to year-round, thanks to the warmth, humidity, and standing water. The parish runs an active mosquito control program. Removing standing water around the home and treating shaded resting areas reduces both bites and risk.",
      },
      {
        question: "What pests get worse after flooding here?",
        answer:
          "Flooding pushes American roaches and rats out of the ground and sewers and into homes, and fire ants raft together on the water before recolonizing. Call volumes climb for weeks after a flood, so post-flood treatment is common in New Orleans.",
      },
      {
        question: "When do Formosan termites swarm?",
        answer:
          "They typically swarm in late spring, often on warm, humid evenings, and the swarms can be large. Seeing a swarm near your home is a strong signal to get an inspection, because it suggests an active colony nearby.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is year-round pest control necessary in New Orleans?",
        answer:
          "For most homes, yes. With no real winter, termites, mosquitoes, roaches, and rats stay active across the year, and flooding adds surges, so a continuous plan holds them back better than occasional visits.",
