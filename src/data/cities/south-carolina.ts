      "Columbia is the state capital of South Carolina, located in the Midlands region where the Piedmont meets the coastal plain. The hot, humid climate delivers long, hot summers and mild winters with occasional frost but rarely sustained cold. The Congaree River to the south, including Congaree National Park, and the Broad River to the west create riparian corridors that sustain year-round mosquito and tick habitat. Clemson University Extension identifies South Carolina as a high termite-pressure state, and Columbia sits in the inland high-activity zone.",

That forest floor, with its persistent flooding and deep organic matter, is exceptional termite and mosquito habitat. Properties on the south side of Columbia, particularly those bordering the Congaree River bottomlands, see pest pressure from the park's ecological margins.",
    intro:
      "Pest control in Columbia is shaped by the Midlands climate and the river corridors that frame the city. Eastern subterranean termites are active throughout Richland County and the warm, moist soils sustain colonies that work year-round. Mosquitoes breed in the Congaree and Broad river bottomlands from March through October. Fire ants are in every lawn. Palmetto bugs move from the drainage system into homes during rain. Brown recluse spiders are present statewide and are a genuine concern in garages and storage areas.",

        heading: "Termite protection in the South Carolina Midlands",
        body: "South Carolina is consistently ranked among the higher-termite-risk states in the Southeast, and the Midlands around Columbia is an active zone within that ranking. The combination of warm temperatures, high annual rainfall, and moist river corridor soils keeps eastern subterranean termite colonies active from February through November. Annual inspections are the standard recommendation from Clemson University Extension for all Richland County properties. Homes with crawl spaces, wood near grade, or deck posts in soil contact are at elevated risk. A proactive protection plan, either liquid soil treatment or a baiting system, prevents damage that would otherwise accumulate undetected.",

        heading: "Palmetto bugs: managing the outdoor-indoor transition",
        body: "American cockroaches (Palmetto bugs) are part of daily outdoor life in Columbia, and the question for most homeowners is how to prevent them from becoming indoor residents. They live in the storm drain system, in mulch, and under leaf litter and push inside during heavy rain events when their outdoor habitat is saturated. The entry points are almost always at the plumbing level: gaps around pipe penetrations under sinks and in walls, floor drain covers that do not seal completely, and gaps around exterior door sills. Sealing those points and maintaining door sweeps addresses the primary transition pathway. A perimeter treatment reduces outdoor population pressure.",

    costNote:
      "Columbia pest control typically starts with a free inspection. Termite protection plans are strongly recommended for all properties and are usually annual. Mosquito programs run March through October. General pest programs for Palmetto bugs, fire ants, and spiders are quarterly.",

        question: "Are termites a serious risk in Columbia?",
        answer:
          "Yes. South Carolina is a high termite-pressure state and Columbia's Midlands climate and river corridor soils sustain eastern subterranean termite populations that are active most of the year. Clemson University Extension recommends annual inspections and proactive protection for all South Carolina properties. By the time termite damage is visible, the colony has typically been working for two to five years.",

        question: "What is a Palmetto bug and how do I keep them out of my Columbia home?",
        answer:
          "Palmetto bug is the common name for the American cockroach in the Carolinas. They are large (1.5 to 2 inches), reddish-brown roaches that live primarily outdoors in the drainage system, mulch, and organic debris. They enter homes through plumbing gaps, drain connections, and under-door gaps. Sealing pipe penetrations under sinks, installing door sweeps, and clearing mulch from the foundation perimeter are the most effective prevention steps. A perimeter treatment also reduces the outdoor population.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is mosquito season in Columbia?",
        answer:
          "March through October in most years. The Congaree River bottomlands and the Broad River corridor provide breeding habitat that sustains populations from early spring through late fall. Properties near the river systems see earlier spring activity and later fall activity than those in the city's interior. Source reduction in the yard and a perimeter barrier treatment through the peak season are the effective management tools.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are brown recluse spiders common in Columbia?",
        answer:
          "They are present throughout South Carolina and are encountered regularly in Columbia's garages, attic spaces, and undisturbed storage areas. Clemson University Extension notes that brown recluse are found statewide. The bite causes a slow-healing wound that can involve significant tissue damage. Using sealed plastic storage bins, wearing gloves when working in undisturbed spaces, and periodic spider treatment of the perimeter and harborage areas reduce the risk.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are fire ants a problem in Columbia neighborhoods?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Red imported fire ants are established throughout Richland County and Columbia's warm Midlands climate keeps them active much of the year. New residential development consistently produces elevated fire ant pressure because construction disturbs soil that fire ants re-colonize quickly. Broadcast bait treatment of the full lawn twice a year is the Clemson University Extension recommendation for ongoing management.",
