        answer:
          "Yes. The Lowcountry's mild winters give red imported fire ants no meaningful suppression, and they rebuild mounds rapidly after rain events and site disturbance. North Charleston's ongoing construction activity disturbs soil that fire ants recolonize within one to two seasons. Broadcast bait treatment of the lawn twice a year is the Clemson University Extension recommendation for managing fire ants in the Lowcountry. Individual mound treatments address the visible mound but not the surrounding population.",

        question: "Should new construction in North Charleston have termite protection?",
        answer:
          "Yes. South Carolina requires pre-construction soil treatment for new builds, but that initial treatment has a finite effective period. North Charleston's Formosan termite pressure means homeowners should establish a monitoring and inspection program before the pre-construction treatment expires. A licensed pest management company can review the original treatment records and recommend the appropriate renewal or supplemental protection approach. Any gap in coverage in Charleston County's Formosan zone carries real structural risk.",
