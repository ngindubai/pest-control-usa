    intro:
      "Pest control in Phoenix is a desert problem, not a humid one. The species that define it are scorpions, desert cockroaches, and subterranean termites that work through dry ground. Bark scorpions are the standout: active on warm nights from late spring through the monsoon, able to slip through hairline gaps, and the only local scorpion whose sting needs medical attention. A good plan here leans heavily on sealing the home, not just spraying it.",

      {
        heading: "Bark scorpions and why exclusion matters most",
        body: "Spraying alone does not solve a scorpion problem, because they hunt at night and shelter deep in walls and block by day. The fix is exclusion: sealing weep holes, door sweeps, and plumbing gaps so they cannot get in, paired with treating the perimeter and the harborage outside. The monsoon months are peak season, so the work is best done before the summer rains.",

        body: "It surprises people that termites thrive in the desert, but desert subterranean termites are widespread across Maricopa County. They build mud tubes up foundations to reach wood while keeping contact with moisture below ground. An inspection looks for those tubes along the slab and any wood-to-soil contact.",

      "Scorpion control in Phoenix usually pays off as a recurring plan, because the peak season is long and exclusion needs upkeep. A free inspection sets the price against your home's gaps and the species present.",

        question: "Are bark scorpions dangerous in Phoenix?",
        answer:
          "The Arizona bark scorpion is the only scorpion in the Phoenix area whose sting is medically significant, and stings can need medical care, particularly for young children. They are most active on warm nights from late spring through the monsoon and get indoors through very small gaps.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why do scorpions get worse during the Phoenix monsoon?",
        answer:
          "The summer monsoon brings moisture and insect prey, which boosts scorpion activity and movement. That is why late spring through September is peak season and why sealing the home before the rains helps.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can termites really survive in the desert?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Desert subterranean termites are widespread across Maricopa County. They keep contact with moist soil below ground and build mud tubes up foundations to reach wood, so annual inspections are worthwhile here.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does spraying alone stop scorpions?",
        answer:
          "Not reliably. Scorpions shelter deep in walls and block by day, so exclusion work, sealing the gaps they use, is the most effective part of the plan, combined with perimeter treatment and clearing harborage outside.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are roof rats a problem in Phoenix?",
        answer:
          "Yes, especially in older neighborhoods with citrus and mature landscaping. Roof rats nest in palms, attics, and dense oleander and travel along walls and branches, so trimming and sealing entry points is key.",
