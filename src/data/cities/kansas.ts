    intro:
      "Pest control in Wichita puts two significant risks front and center. The city sits in the core geographic range of the brown recluse, a spider that Kansas State University Extension confirms is a common household pest across the state. And the Arkansas River valley gives Wichita above-average subterranean termite pressure for a city on the Great Plains. Cold winters drive mice into buildings every fall, German cockroaches are year-round indoors, and the river corridor feeds a solid mosquito season in spring and summer.",

        body: "Wichita is in brown recluse range, which means these spiders are a common find in garages, storage rooms, closets, and attics, not a rare or dramatic event. Kansas State University Extension has published this clearly. The spider is not aggressive and bites are uncommon, but in some cases a bite can cause a significant wound. The practical response is regular perimeter treatment, storing items in sealed plastic containers rather than open cardboard boxes, and checking undisturbed areas periodically. Living sensibly with this common regional pest is more useful than alarm.",

        heading: "Termite pressure in the Arkansas River valley",

KSU Extension identifies the region as having elevated termite activity, driven by the river valley's moisture and soil composition. The first sign of an established colony is usually a spring swarm of winged termites indoors, often around window frames or near the foundation. Annual inspections are the practical defense.",

          "Yes. Wichita is within the core geographic range of the brown recluse, and Kansas State University Extension confirms they are a common household pest throughout Kansas. Finding them in garages, closets, and storage areas is not unusual. Regular treatment and keeping storage in sealed containers reduces contact significantly.",

        question: "How serious is the termite risk in Wichita?",
        answer:
          "Above average for a Great Plains city. Kansas State University Extension identifies the Arkansas River valley, where Wichita sits, as having elevated subterranean termite pressure. Annual inspections are recommended, particularly for homes with crawl spaces or older wood-frame construction.",
      },
      {
        question: "When do mice become a problem in Wichita?",
        answer:
          "The surge typically arrives in October and November as Kansas temperatures drop. Homes on the outskirts near agricultural areas also see field mouse pressure in addition to the standard house mouse. Sealing foundation gaps and utility penetrations in September prevents them from getting established.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do cockroaches survive Wichita winters?",
        answer:
          "German cockroaches do, because they live entirely indoors in heated spaces and are not affected by outdoor temperatures. American cockroaches can survive in basements and warm infrastructure year-round. The cold winters do not reduce indoor cockroach pressure.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is year-round pest control necessary in Wichita?",
        answer:
          "For homes with brown recluse pressure, recurring mice activity, or cockroach activity, yes. These are year-round concerns. Outdoor pests like ants and wasps are seasonal. An annual termite inspection is also a sensible addition given the river valley's elevated pressure.",
