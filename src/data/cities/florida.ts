    intro:
      "Pest control in Miami comes down to one fact: there is no off-season. The warmth and humidity that make the city what it is also keep termites, mosquitoes, and roaches active all year. Compared with a northern city, where pests retreat each winter, Miami homes need continuous protection rather than a seasonal blitz. Termites are the headline risk, with three damaging types in play, but the day-to-day battle is mosquitoes and palmetto bugs.",

        heading: "Year-round pressure versus a northern winter",
        body: "In a cold-winter city, a hard freeze ends the mosquito season and slows everything else. Miami never gets that reset. By contrast, the species here simply keep breeding, so a one-time treatment fades fast. The approach that works is steady, with the perimeter and entry points handled on a schedule rather than sprayed once and forgotten.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Three termite types, not one",
        body: "Most cities worry about a single termite type. Miami has three that matter: native subterranean, invasive Formosan, and drywood. Subterranean and Formosan come up from the soil, whereas drywood termites live entirely inside wood and can arrive in infested furniture. That difference changes the treatment, which is why an inspection here identifies the type before any work begins.",

      "Tip out anything holding water, even bottle caps, to deny Aedes mosquitoes a breeding site.",
      "Have an annual termite inspection given the three damaging types active locally.",

    ],
    costNote:
      "Because nothing here has an off-season, Miami homes usually do best on a year-round plan. Termite protection is priced separately from general pest control, and both start with a free inspection so the quote matches your property.",

        question: "Why does Miami have such a termite problem?",
        answer:
          "South Florida sits in one of the highest termite-pressure regions in the United States, and Miami has three damaging types active: native subterranean, invasive Formosan, and drywood. The year-round warmth means there is no season when the risk drops, so annual inspections are strongly recommended.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are mosquitoes a health risk in Miami?",
        answer:
          "The Aedes aegypti mosquito here can carry viruses, and Miami-Dade recorded local Zika transmission in 2016. The county treats it as a public-health priority. Removing standing water and treating shaded resting areas reduces both the bites and the risk.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are palmetto bugs?",
        answer:
          "Palmetto bug is the local name for the large American cockroach. They thrive in Miami's heat and humidity, breed outdoors, and fly toward lights on warm evenings before working their way indoors.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do drywood termites need different treatment?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Drywood termites live entirely inside wood and do not need soil contact, unlike subterranean and Formosan termites. That means a soil barrier alone will not stop them, so the inspection identifies the type before recommending treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is year-round pest control necessary in Miami?",
        answer:
          "For most homes, yes. Without a cold winter to reduce numbers, pests stay active all year, so a continuous plan holds them back far better than occasional one-time visits.",
