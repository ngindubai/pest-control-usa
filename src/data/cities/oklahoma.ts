Some individuals have allergic reactions. Treating mounds as they appear and doing a yard survey after rain events keeps the risk manageable.",

Oklahoma State University Extension has documented that brown recluses are common here, often present in numbers in undisturbed storage areas, garages, and attics.

Mosquitoes, by contrast, are sharply seasonal, peaking from April through October around the river, lakes, and storm water. The practical takeaway is different timing for each: an annual termite inspection on a fixed schedule, versus seasonal mosquito management that ramps up in spring and winds down in fall.",
