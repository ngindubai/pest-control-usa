      "Oklahoma City sits squarely in brown recluse country. These spiders are not a rare find here the way they are in northern states. They are common in garages, under stored boxes, and in attics across the metro area. Combined with the state's heavy termite pressure, pest control here addresses risks that most northern homeowners simply don't face.",
    intro:
      "Pest control in Oklahoma City comes with a risk most homeowners moving here from northern states don't expect: brown recluse spiders are genuinely common in OKC, not a rare occurrence. Oklahoma State University Extension confirms this city is in the heart of brown recluse range, and finding them in garages, closets, and stored boxes is routine. Subterranean termites add the financial risk, fire ants are a yard-wide concern, and the mosquito season runs a solid six months from April through October.",

        heading: "Why are brown recluse spiders such a concern here?",
        body: "Oklahoma City is in the core geographic range of the brown recluse, which extends from Nebraska to Texas and from Kansas to Georgia. In this range, the spider is a common household pest, not a rare encounter. They favor undisturbed, dry, dark spaces: the back of a closet, under a box in the garage, inside shoes that haven't been worn in months. The bite is rarely felt at first but can cause a significant wound in some people, so knowing they are present and taking sensible precautions matters. Storage areas and items that have been in the garage should be treated with care.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Termite pressure across Oklahoma",
        body: "Oklahoma falls in the heavy to moderate termite hazard zone on the USDA map. The warm, humid summers and the clay soils across the Oklahoma City area support subterranean termite colonies that can remain hidden until the spring swarm season reveals them. Annual inspections are particularly important for homes with crawl spaces, wood siding, or any structural wood near soil.",
      },
    ],
    prevention: [
      "Shake out shoes, gloves, and clothing that has been stored in the garage or closet to avoid brown recluse contact.",
      "Keep stored boxes off the floor and in sealed plastic containers where possible.",
      "Have an annual termite inspection, especially for homes with crawl spaces.",

      "OKC pest control is commonly quoted as a general pest plan covering roaches, spiders, ants, and rodents, with termite protection quoted separately after an inspection. Spider-specific treatments for heavy brown recluse activity may be quoted as an add-on. Start with a free assessment.",

        question: "Are brown recluse spiders really common in Oklahoma City?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Oklahoma is within the core geographic range of the brown recluse, and Oklahoma State University Extension confirms they are a genuinely common household pest in this region. Finding them in garages, closets, and under stored items is not unusual. Sensible precautions around undisturbed storage areas significantly reduce the risk of contact.",
      },
      {
        question: "How serious is the termite problem in OKC?",
        answer:
          "Significant. Oklahoma falls in the heavy to moderate termite hazard zone on the USDA Forest Service map. The warm, humid summers support active subterranean termite colonies, and the first visible sign is often the spring swarm of winged termites indoors. Annual inspections are the practical defense, particularly for homes with crawl spaces.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do fire ants really sting enough to be a real concern?",
        answer:
          "Yes, particularly for children and pets who may not notice a mound before disturbing it. Fire ants defend mounds aggressively, and people and animals can receive multiple stings quickly. Some individuals have allergic reactions. Treating mounds as they appear and doing a yard survey after rain events keeps the risk manageable.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is the mosquito season in Oklahoma City?",
        answer:
          "Roughly April through October, with peak pressure in July and August following rain events. The North Canadian River corridor and the city's lakes and retention ponds all provide breeding habitat. West Nile virus activity has been recorded in Oklahoma County in past years.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is the most important pest concern for a new homeowner in OKC?",
        answer:
          "For a new homeowner, an annual termite inspection is the most important scheduled action given the heavy termite pressure in Oklahoma. For everyday safety, understanding that brown recluse spiders are common and knowing which areas of the home to handle with care is equally important.",
